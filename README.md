This system allows users to register as voters and candidates. Each voter can only vote two times per election while each candidate will have an accumulated number of votes to indicate the winners.

1. Register
Users are allowed to register their account into this automated voting system by using this function.
2. Log In
The Log In function allows users to log in to their registered account and access the system features and the system would not allow users to perform any system feature before they had logged in successfully.
3. Remove Account
The Remove Account function allows users to remove or cancel their registered account from the system. After the user removes their account from the system, they would not be able to login with the account anymore.
4. Edit Profile
The Edit Profile function allows users to update their personal information in the system.
5. Log Out
The Log Out function allows users to log out of the system and end their session.
6. Print Voters
